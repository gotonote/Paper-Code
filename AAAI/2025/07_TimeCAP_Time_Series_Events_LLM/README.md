# TimeCAP
Code and datasets of **TimeCAP: Learning to Contextualize, Augment, and Predict Time Series Events with Large Language Model Agents**, (AAAI 2025).

- The arXiv version can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11418).
- The supplementary document can be found [here](supplementary.pdf).

## Time Series Datasets
We release seven time series datasets from three different domains, which can be found [here](dataset). 

- 🌤️ **Weather**: weather_ny (New York), weather_sf (San Francisco), and weather_hs (Houston)
- 💰 **Finance**: finance_sp500 (S&P 500) and finance_nikkei (Nikkei 225)
- 🏥 **Healthcare**: healthcare_mortality (Mortality Rate) and healthcare_positive (Test-Positive Rate)

You can load the dataset as follows (e.g., weather datasets):
```python
import pickle as pkl

with open('indices.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    indices = pkl.load(f)

with open(f'time_series_{city}.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    data = pkl.load(f)
```

You can load the labels of time series events as follows (e.g., weather datasets):
```python
with open(f'rain_{city}.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    labels = pkl.load(f)

# weather
0: not rained / 1: rained

# finance
0: decreased / 1: neutral / 2: increased

# healthcare
0: did not exceed the average / 1: exceeded the average
```

The total number of events is given by `len(indices)`. The correspondence between the time series and labels is as follows:
```python
for _i in range(len(indices)):
    i = indices[_i]
    # Time series
    time_series = data[i:i+window_size]
    # Label
    label = labels[_i]
```

Each dataset directory contains:
- **`gpt_summary`**: Textual summaries of time series generated by GPT-4.
- **`gpt_predict_time`**: Predictions generated by GPT-4 based on time series.
- **`gpt_predict_text`**: Predictions generated by GPT-4 based on textual summaries (**TimeCP**).
- **`gpt_predict_in-context`**: Predictions generated by **TimeCAP**.

## P1. Contextualization of Time Series
We contextualize time series using LLM. The prompt of each dataset is as follows:
